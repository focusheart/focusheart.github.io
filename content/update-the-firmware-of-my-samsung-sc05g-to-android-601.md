Update my Samsung S6 SC-05G to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow!
It's quite simple, just following this post: [Samsung Galaxy S6 SC-05G 6.0.1 Marshmallow Firmware](http://www.androidinfotech.com/2016/10/samsung-galaxy-s6-sc-05g-marshmallow-firmware.html).

The steps as follows:

1. Download Samsung USB Driver to PC. The original post provided this link: https://bitbucket.org/Serverbee/downloadbee/downloads/Samsung-Usb-Driver-v1.5.55.0.exe , but I found it didn't work for me (on Windows 10). I'm lucky that for no reason Galaxy S6 could connect to my laptop in Downloading Mode.

2. Download Odin to PC. https://bitbucket.org/Serverbee/downloadbee/downloads/SM-G900I-TELSTRA-LOLLIPOP-Odin.rar

3. Download Samsung Galaxy S6 SC-05G 6.0.1 Marshmallow Firmware to PC and extract the `.img` file. http://www.firmwares.androidinfotech.com/samsung-galaxy-s6-sc-05g-firmwares/

4. Switch off S6. Enter in Download Mode by press **Volumne Down + Home Button + Power Button** at same time, until saw downloading screen.

5. Connect S6 to PC.

6. Launch Odin application. It will show a message "Added!!". If not, repeat step 4,5,6 or seek help.

7. Select the firmware file (press PDA button), Odin will check the MD5.

8. Tick "Auto Reboot" and box on the left of PDA button. Press **Start** button.

9. Wait until Odin display a green **PASS** and the S6 will reboot and apply changes.

10. That's all, it's just a beginning for people who use special network...OMG.
