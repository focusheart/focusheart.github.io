I designed a homework for HTML/CSS/JS basics. Implement a web-based calculator!
It's quite simple to write a program for an experienced programmer, 
but for a beginner it may take a while.

Also, there are some rules:

1. all buttons are functional as a real calculator does
2. single page, no links to external resources such as jQuery
3. multi-browser supported is prefered.
4. as precise as it looks

Do you wanna try? I have writen a version (tested in Chrome)
